When creating a FiveM server, there are 3 options available:
:one: **The easiest way:**
        :point_right: DDoS protected & pre-configured FiveM txAdmin server is on ZAP-Hosting
        :point_right: https://zap-hosting.com/txAdmin
:two: **Home hosting:**
        Running the server on your PC is NOT recommended due to performance, security, and ease of configuration reasons, please use the link above.
:three: **VPS Server:**
        Usually ZAP, OVH and Google Cloud are used.
        This is usually the most powerful but more expensive way.
